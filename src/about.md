Hi! This is an italian dictionary finder, based on a table of 2000 most common italian words and their english translations. The list is a bit shorter though: I removed some names and duplicates. The origin of the list is: <a href="https://invokeit.wordpress.com/frequency-word-lists/">https://invokeit.wordpress.com/frequency-word-lists/</a>.
